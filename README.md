## Summary

Coin Pal is inspired by paypal based on the idea of a Peer to Peer blockchain economy. The main purpose of the app is to faciliate the transfer of crypto between the users without the need to include the wallet hash with each transaction(similar to Venmo). This is a concept app and no real Crypto is being used. The front end of this application was made with React and it follows Redux architecture. The backend was developed using Flask and PostgresSQL. The APIs are designed around REST principles. The final touch and design was also created using raw CSS.
